\section{Overview}
\textbf{Game Engine:} Blender Game Engine\\
\textbf{Genre:} 3D Third-person Shooter Survival\\
\textbf{Title:} Narwhals of Good Sleep

\section{Storyline and Objective}
\subsection{Outline}
The player is a penguin who is trying to protect themselves from hungry narwhals. The player must also defend their egg (the flag). Unfortunately, the narwhals have surrounded the penguin and are closing in for their final four attacks. The player must survive these attacks in order to win the game. To defend itself the penguin has learned to use firearms and will shoot at the narwhals. Each gun will have its own ammunition. The player can hold an unlimited amount of ammunition.

\subsection{Setting}
\subsubsection{Map Properties}
\begin{itemize}
\item Underwater theme (close to shoreline)
\item Circular in shape
\item It will take the player around 1 minute to cross or 30 seconds from the middle to an edge.
\item Four main locations: Beach, Coral Reef, Sunken Ship, and Underwater Vents/Volcano
\item Items will spawn randomly around the map but weapons are unique to the region in which they are found.
\end{itemize}

\item Rifle

\end{itemize}
\subsection{Objective}
\textbf{Protect the Flag}

\subsubsection{Start}
The Player will spawn in the center of the map with the flag in front of them to defend. The player must find a weapon/weapons to defend him/herself with and to defend the flag. Certain weapons spawn in certain regions. The player can only carry the flag or a single weapon at a time.

\subsubsection{Waves}
The player will have one minute to move the flag and gather weapons before the waves of enemies spawn. A predetermined amount of enemies of a set difficulty will spawn per wave. Each wave will last approximately 2-3 minutes. Enemies will attempt to kill the player or flag depending on which is closest and visible. If the player is holding the flag then the enemies will try to attack the player. If the player is damaged while holding the flag they drop it and can't pick it up for 1.5 seconds.\\

After the wave completes, the player will have 1 minute to move to another area and collect new weapons and ammunition before the next wave begins.

\subsection{If the player dies}
If the player dies, their currently equipped weapon is dropped and they will respawn on top of the flag after 5 seconds with the default weapon.
\subsection{How to win}
Survive 4 waves of 2-3 minute continuous spawns. Difficulty increases with each wave. Don't let the flag be destroyed (egg).
\subsection{How to lose}
The flag (egg) is destroyed by the enemies.
